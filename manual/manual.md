## Basic Functions

### Generating, Loading, and Opening a Maze

1. **Pre-Generation Options**: Before generating a new maze, select the desired options such as maze complexity, cell size, etc.
   
2. **Generate a Maze**: Click the "Generate" button after setting the options.

3. **Load a Maze from File**: Click the "Load" button to load a saved maze.

4. **Open an Existing Maze**: Use the "Open" button to open a maze that you have already created.

### Finding the Path

1. **Preparation**: Click the "Find Path" button to set the application in pathfinding mode.

2. **Coordinate Selection**: Make two clicks on the maze widget for the start and end coordinates. The first click is for the start point, and the second is for the end point.

3. **Show the Way**: Click the "Show the Way" button to execute the wave algorithm and visualize the shortest path.
